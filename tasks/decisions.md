## Example

### ADR-001: Use Zod for request validation
- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Status**: accepted
- **Context**: API endpoints accept user input without validation. Need runtime validation with TypeScript type inference.
- **Options**:
  - A) Zod — Pros: TypeScript-first, small bundle, great DX / Cons: another dependency
  - B) Joi — Pros: mature, battle-tested / Cons: no TS inference, larger
  - C) Manual validation — Pros: no dependency / Cons: error-prone, verbose
- **Decision**: Zod (A). TypeScript inference eliminates duplicate type definitions. Small enough to justify the dependency.
- **Consequences**: All route handlers must validate input with Zod schemas. Schemas live in `src/schemas/`.

### ADR-003: Hook-shift — move prompt-based discipline rules into deterministic lifecycle hooks
- **Date**: 2026-05-16
- **Status**: accepted
- **Context**: CLAUDE.md enforces "Verification (Mandatory Order)", "Session Boot (Tiered)", "Protected Changes (Approval Required)" via prompt. These depend on model goodwill — Claude can ignore, forget, or skip them. Inspired by Nader Dabit's "Agent Hooks: Deterministic Control for Agent Workflows" (2026-05-15), which argues: *"Use prompts for guidance. Use hooks for behavior that should run every time."* Mapped existing kit hooks against the canonical 6 lifecycle points and identified gaps: no SessionStart, no SessionEnd, no completion gate on Stop, minimal UserPromptSubmit.
- **Options**:
  - A) **Core 3** — Only the highest-leverage gaps: session-start, quality-gate, stop-gate. Skips PreToolUse architectural protection and SessionEnd audit. Lower risk, faster to ship.
  - B) **Full 6** — All six lifecycle points covered: session-start, prompt-router, protect-changes, quality-gate, stop-gate, session-end. Complete framework, larger change, requires `.hook-state/` directory and `.gitignore` update.
  - C) **Minimum (gate only)** — Just quality-gate + stop-gate. Solves the strongest Nader argument (completion gating) but leaves Tier 1 boot and audit as prompt-only.
- **Decision**: B (Full 6). Rationale: the kit's positioning is "disciplined staff engineer behavior" — partial coverage undermines the value prop. Completion gating without auto-context (session-start) leaves a gap where Claude skips Tier 1. Architectural protection (protect-changes) is the second-most-frequent prompt-rule violation per user reports. Once the `.hook-state/` infrastructure is in place, adding the remaining hooks is cheap.
- **Sub-decisions**:
  - **quality-gate profile**: enabled in both `standard` and `strict`. Rationale: deterministic verification is core, not optional. Users on broken test infra use the escape hatch.
  - **stop-gate behavior**: hard-block (exit 2) with `SKIP_QUALITY_GATE=1` env-var escape. Rationale: soft-warn defeats the purpose — completion would still depend on model reading stderr.
- **Consequences**:
  - 6 new hooks: `session-start.sh`, `prompt-router.sh`, `protect-changes.sh`, `quality-gate.sh`, `stop-gate.sh`, `session-end.sh`
  - New transient state directory: `.hook-state/` (gitignored, created on demand by quality-gate.sh)
  - New audit log: `reports/session-audit.log` (gitignored)
  - `CLAUDE.md` rules annotated with `(enforced via <hook>)` where the hook now covers them — prompt remains as documentation of intent
  - `protect-changes.sh` is opinionated about which paths are "architectural" (package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, Gemfile, migrations/**, **/auth/**, **/security/**, Dockerfile, build configs, `.github/workflows/**`) — projects loosen the policy by removing the hook from `.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse and adding a custom replacement under `.claude/hooks/project/`. There is no auto-sourcing override mechanism; the swap is explicit in settings.
  - Existing prompt-based rules in `CLAUDE.md` are NOT removed — they continue to serve as documentation and as the source of truth for *why* the hooks exist
  - Upgrade path: `install.sh --upgrade` adds the 6 hooks without overwriting `CLAUDE.project.md` or project-specific hooks

### ADR-002: Squash-only merge for kit and web repos
- **Date**: 2026-04-26
- **Status**: accepted
- **Context**: Past CHANGELOGs (v1.6.0–v1.7.2) showed every PR's bug-fix line *twice*. Each entry came from (1) the original `fix:`/`feat:` commit on the feature branch and (2) the merge commit GitHub creates on `--merge`, whose body auto-inherits the feature branch's HEAD commit subject. release-please's conventional-commits parser saw both and emitted two entries per PR.
- **Options**:
  - A) **Squash merge only** — single commit on `main` with PR title as subject. One changelog entry per PR. Loses intermediate branch commits (acceptable for this repo size).
  - B) **Rebase merge only** — replays each commit on `main` linearly. No merge commit pollution. But every "fix lint" / "address review" commit ends up in changelog separately.
  - C) **Keep merge + filter release-please** — config a regex to drop merge commits. Brittle, depends on release-please internals.
- **Decision**: A (squash only). Disabled `--enable-merge-commit` and `--enable-rebase-merge` at GitHub repo level for both `claude-code-kit` and `claude-code-kit-web` so the wrong strategy can't be selected by mistake.
- **Consequences**:
  - Future PRs must be merged with `gh pr merge --squash` (the only option GitHub now exposes).
  - release-please will produce one changelog entry per PR.
  - Past v1.6.x / 1.7.x duplicate entries remain — git history is immutable, fixing them isn't worth a force-push.
  - Documented in `agent_docs/conventions.md` under "Merging Pull Requests".
